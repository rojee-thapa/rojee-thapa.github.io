what_i_learned: |
   Today, we practiced our presentation multiple times to help improve the overall quality and flow of both our demo video and the presentation. Each attempt allowed us to identify small issues and make improvements, which made us more confident. We divided the presentation into sections among team members, which made the process more manageable and kept things organized. This allowed everyone to focus on their part and deliver it more effectively. Our mentor’s feedback was especially helpful in refining both the content and our delivery. We also realized that staying within the time limit requires careful planning and coordination, and practicing with a timer made a big difference

  
blockers: |
   Recording the demo video was challenging and took multiple attempts to get it right. We faced issues with timing, delivery, and technical setup, which made the process time-consuming. Managing the presentation time was also difficult at first, as we often went over the allotted limit. It required us to adjust our content and pace, which took extra effort and coordination.
   


reflection: |
   Presenting in front of others, even with preparation, is still nerve-racking — and I’ve learned that’s completely okay. This is my first major presentation, and while I do feel nervous, I’m also excited to finally go through it. Today showed me that consistent practice and strong teamwork can lead to real improvement. Working together and supporting each other made the process less stressful and more effective. I’m looking forward to completing the presentation.
