what_i_learned: |
   Today, I attended an Overleaf workshop where I learned many useful things about writing and formatting a research paper. They explained how to write the title, author names, and affiliations properly. I also learned how to organize my Overleaf project by creating separate files and including them in the main document to keep everything clean and structured. Another important part was learning how to add references correctly using Overleaf. We also discussed the 90-second elevator pitch and how to prepare for the final presentation. After the workshop, I returned to the lab and continued updating my project, made the changes suggested by my professor, added a bar plot for time, improved the methodology section, and added more content to the introduction. I also worked on comparing the results and explaining them clearly.

reflection: |
   Today was very productive and focused on learning how to write a research paper properly. The Overleaf workshop helped me understand how to structure and format my paper in a professional way. I also felt more confident about my project after making the required changes and organizing my work more effectively. It was a valuable day of learning. It gave me a better understanding of how important clear formatting and organization are in research writing. I feel good being able to learn something new everyday.
