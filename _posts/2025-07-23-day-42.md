what_i_learned: |
   Today was a productive day as I focused mainly on our group research paper and final presentation. I started by working on the methodology and abstract sections of the paper. To write effectively, I created a rough outline for both the research paper and the presentation. This outline will guide me as we continue working on both. I also spent time updating my Overleaf project, making changes so that it can be added to the group research paper. I reviewed what was already written, corrected any mistakes, and revised parts to better fit the final version.


  
blockers: |
   Thankfully, there were no blockers today. Everything went smoothly, and I was able to stay productive throughout the day. Working on different parts of the project side by side helped me stay motivated and avoid getting stuck.



reflection: |
   Even though I spent most of the day writing, it didn’t feel boring or overwhelming. Switching between the research paper and the presentation helped me stay focused and creative. It made it easier to come up with ideas and stay on track. We also worked on our elevator pitch video today. We tried out a new idea, and while it turned out okay, we haven’t decided yet which version we’ll submit. Overall, I feel good about the progress we made. Since our program is coming to an end, it feels great to see everything coming together.
