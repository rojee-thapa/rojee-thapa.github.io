what_i_learned: |
   Today, I continued working on my Parkinson’s disease project. I made some changes to my code for balancing data and cross-validation, especially improving how I calculate the percentage difference. After that, I updated my table in Overleaf. Then, I switched to MATLAB to work on imbalanced data without cross-validation. Since it had been a while since I used MATLAB, I had to review some of my old work to remember how things work. I tried different machine learning models like KNN, SVM, decision tree, and random forest. And also my customized elm with different activations(sigmoid, ReLu, tanh). Because I had already done  the coding in Python, it was easier to code in MATLAB.

  
blockers: |
   I ran into a few problems today. At first, I didn’t have the necessary MATLAB toolbox for machine learning, so I had to install free Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to continue. I also faced issues with the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model, so I decided to skip it for now and focus on the other models. Making the code run smoothly in MATLAB took more time than I expected, mainly because I had to adjust to the differences from Python.
   


reflection: |
   Working with MATLAB today made me realize how important it is to keep practicing different programming languages so I don’t forget them. Since I already knew the concepts from Python, coding was easier, but switching between languages was confusing. Tomorrow, I plan to figure out how to use ELM properly and finish evaluating my models. Overall, it was a good day of learning and progress.
