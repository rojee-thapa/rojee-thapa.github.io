what_i_learned: |
   Today I focused on finishing our midterm presentation by editing and filling in the necessary information. I also worked with the Parkinson’s dataset using the ELM model our mentor provided instead of the one I installed. This version gave much better results, with an accuracy of 92%, which is a big improvement over the online ELM. I realized that using the provided ELM helped avoid the errors we faced before, possibly because the installed version was different or missing parts.

   One of the challenges I faced today was making the presentation clear and making sure I could explain everything well. I spent a lot of time organizing the slides and thinking about how to communicate the content simply and effectively. This took some effort, but I knew it was important to make the presentation easy to follow.
   


reflection: |
   Overall, it was a good and productive day. I really enjoyed working together with my teammates on the demo video and preparing for the presentation. It felt great to collaborate, share ideas, and help each other. I’m feeling more confident now, and I hope the presentation goes well. It was fun to work as a team, and it made the process more enjoyable.
