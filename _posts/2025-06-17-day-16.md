what_i_learned: |
   Today, I continued machine learning by learning about the Random Forest algorithm.
   I practiced using real-world data and calculated different evaluation metrics like
   accuracy, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. I also learned how to visualize model predictions
   using a confusion matrix. After that, I explored Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA), which is used to reduce the number of features while keeping the important
   information. PCA was interesting because it helps simplify complex data while
   still keeping most of its structure. I then moved on to Convolutional Neural
   Networks (CNNs) and their different layers such as the convolution layer, ReLU
   layer, pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers. These layers help CNNs
   recognize patterns in images and are especially useful in image classification
   tasks. I found it fascinating how each layer has its own role and how they work
   together to make decisions. Learning how CNNs process images step by step helped
   me understand why deep learning is so powerful. Seeing how these models work on
   real data gave me a better picture of how machine learning is used in real-life
   problems.
 

  
blockers: |
   There were no blockers today, but the day itself wasn’t the best — it rained all
   day, which made the day feel a little slower.


reflection: |
   I also spent some time reviewing the research papers we were given. Although I
   haven’t finished reading all of them yet, I came across some interesting ideas
   that I might include in my final selection. Hopefully, I will be able to choose
   the four research papers soon. Overall, I feel more comfortable with machine
   learning concepts than I did yesterday. Using real datasets made it easier to
   understand how things work in practice. I’m beginning to get the basic idea and
   see how each algorithm and technique fits together. It was a productive and
   encouraging day of learning.
