what_i_learned: |
   Over the past few days, I've learned a lot about machine learning and how they work. I now understand the difference
   between types of data - numeric data can be measured, while categorical data is grouped - and the four main types of
   machine learning:supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Most real-world applications,
   including tools like ChatGPT, use supervised learning, where labeled data helps guide the model. Within that,
   classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting numeric values) are the two main tasks. Decision
   trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that splits data recursively to create the purest possible groups.
   I also learned about important concepts like Gini impurity, which helps determine the best feature to split on, and
   how one-hot encoding and get_dummies() are used to convert categorical data into numerical format. Since I had
   already explored random forests before, these ideas felt more familiar and easier to follow.
 

  
blockers: |
   There were no blockers to learning today, as it was mainly a revision of what I had learned over the past few days
   about machine learning.


reflection: |
   We had our SAIRI cohort session today since tomorrow is Juneteenth, and it was a lot of fun. We started with a Q&A
   and then played a survival game where we ranked 15 items in order of importance, imagining we were stranded in the
   middle of the ocean — a great way to bond and think critically as a group. Later, we met our teachers in a creative
   way: by describing our projects without using keywords and having them guess if we belonged in their group. That’s
   how we met our new group member, Ron, who was very welcoming and approachable. As an icebreaker, he asked us to use a
   ChatGPT prompt to get a job suggestion based on our interests. Ron also shared that he is a high school teacher and
   that this is his third year with CEAMLS. He shared that he’s here to support and guide us throughout the research. He
   was really kind, encouraging, and it was fun getting to know him.
