what_i_learned: |
   Today, I learned how to clearly explain the results in my research paper and make sure everything is clear and complete. I updated my Overleaf by going through my explanations and making sure I included all the important details. I also created bar plots to show my results in a visual way, which helped make the data easier to understand. I noticed that I was missing time information in my table, so I changed my code to get separate training and testing times and updated the table. This taught me how important it is to double check and improve both my code and my writing. During our meeting, my faculty mentor suggested that I compare the three customized ELM models, pick the best one, and then compare it with the traditional ELM. This will help make the results more meaningful and show which model works best. It made me realize that comparing models clearly can help readers better understand my results.

   I didn’t really face any big problems today, but the work needed focus and patience. Changing the code to get the separate training and testing times took some effort, but it wasn’t too hard. The main challenge was making sure that all the explanations were clear and complete. I had to spend time reading through everything and making sure it made sense.



reflection: |
   Overall, I feel good about what I did today. I think my explanation of the results is much better now clearer and more detailed than before. When I read it today, I felt that I did a good job. The feedback from my mentor helped a lot and gave me new ideas to improve my writing. It showed me how important it is to get feedback and keep improving. Today’s work reminded me that even small changes and clear explanations can make a big difference in a research paper.
