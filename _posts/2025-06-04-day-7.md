what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued my Python learning by continuing where I left yesterday. Today I could complete the following topics:handling text data, numeric data, managing date and time information, and merging data.
  In handling text data, I explored various string operations such as splitting, replacing, and converting case. Using methods like .str.split(), .str.replace(), .str.lower(), and .str.upper(), I learned how to clean and transform textual information within datasets. 
  When working with numeric data, I learned about centering and scaling techniques. In managing date and time information, I utilized pd.to_datetime() to convert string representations of dates or odd dates into Pandas datetime objects. Once converted, I learned how to extract specific components such as the year, month, second and others using .dt.year, .dt.month, and .dt.second. 
  Lastly, I practiced merging two different tables using pd.merge() and .join(). These functions combine multiple tables based on the type of join used—such as outer, inner, left, or right—using common columns.

  There were no significant blockers today. I encountered some unfamiliar concepts, but I took the time to understand each topic thoroughly. By practicing with examples and referring to documentation, I was able to understand it.


reflection: |
   Today's learning experience has been valuable in developing practical skills for handling various data types and performing essential data transformations. I'm excited to apply these techniques in my research. Learning data analysis has made me realize the importance of consistent practice to use these new concepts comfortably and remember them in the long term. To become more comfortable with these concepts, I plan to dedicate time to learning and revising the topics.I'm eager to continue this learning path and look forward to tomorrow.
