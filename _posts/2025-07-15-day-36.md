what_i_learned: |
   Today I learned more about myself through the MBTI and VARK tests. My MBTI result was ISTP, and my VARK result showed that I am a mild kinesthetic learner. This means I learn best by doing things with my hands or through real-life experience. The ISTP personality is also known as "the crafter," which fits well with how I like to learn and work. I found it interesting to see how my personality can affect how I do research and solve problems. Understanding this can help me use my strengths for better and work on my weakness.  I spent time working on updating my Overleaf document and explaining my results. 


  
blockers: |
   There were no major blockers today. Everything went smoothly during the workshop and research lab.
   


reflection: |
   The workshop was a good experience. Learning about my personality and learning style helped me understand myself better. It was also interesting to work as a group and create a presentation based on our project idea and team strengths. Instead of a normal presentation in front of the class, we did a gallery walk where others came to us. I liked this style more because it felt more comfortable and less stressful. Overall, it was a useful and enjoyable day of learning and working.
