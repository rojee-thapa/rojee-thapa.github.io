what_i_learned: |
   Today, I continued working on the balanced data without using cross-validation. I evaluated the data using my customized ELM model with tanh and sigmoid activation functions. After that, I worked on the balanced data with cross-validation. For this part, I started from the beginning by cleaning the data, removing duplicate columns, and handling missing values. I also updated the new results in Overleaf.

   
   My faculty mentor gave me helpful advice on how to improve the way I present my results in Overleaf. He suggested making the results easier to understand for others who might read my project. He recommended adding comments to each table to explain the results clearly and creating plots to visualize the outcomes. These suggestions helped me realize the importance of not only doing the analysis but also presenting it in a clear and organized way.

   The biggest challenge I faced today was writing the code for cross-validation for multiple models. I kept running into small errors that were hard to spot and fix. Even after correcting them, the code didn’t work as expected, which was frustrating. Because of that, I decided to go back to the beginning and start fresh with data cleaning and balancing. That helped me get the models running properly, but it still took a lot of time and effort.
   


reflection: |
   Today was a good opportunity to look back and see how much I’ve accomplished during the week. Meeting with my faculty mentor and graduated mentor and explaining what I had done helped me receive valuable feedback. Their suggestions helped me understand the improvements and changes I need to make going forward. Similarly, reviewing all my past work and checking my code again gave me a clearer picture of the steps I’ve taken and the areas that still need improvement. It was a helpful way to organize my thoughts and get a better view of the overall progress of my project. Even though some parts were challenging, I feel like I’ve made solid progress. I now feel more confident about what I need to focus on next and how to continue moving forward with my project.
