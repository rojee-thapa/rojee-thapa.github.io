what_i_learned: |
   Today was my first experience with machine learning, and it was both exciting and
   educational. Our mentors gave us an introduction to what machine learning is ,types of
   machine learning and how it works. After that, we started working with real datasets
   to get the idea of how it works. I started by learning the ELM (Extreme Learning
   Machine) method, then moved on to KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and SVM (Support Vector
   Machine). For each method, I used real data to calculate accuracy, mean absolute error
   (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and percentage error.
   This helped me understand how different models are used for similar tasks.

   There were no obstacles today; everything went smoothly and was filled with learning.


reflection: |
   Overall, it was fun o see how machine learning works with real data. I enjoyed
   exploring how each model performed and how we can evaluate them using different
   metrics. The hands-on practice helped me understand the machine learning workflow —
   from preparing data, splitting it, training the model, to making predictions. This
   experience gave me a good idea about machine learning and made me more interested in 
   learning about other machine learning techniques. I’m excited to continue this journey 
   and see what more I can do with data and models. Learning by doing is one of the best 
   ways to understand complex topics like machine learning.
