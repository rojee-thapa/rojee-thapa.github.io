what_i_learned: |
   Today, I started using R and RStudio, where I learned how to create and customize different types of plots, including histograms,
   rug plots, density plots, boxplots, line plots, and scatter plots. I learned functions that enhance visualizations of plot, such
   as adding lines, curves, legends, and adjusting colors and styles. I was also introduced to ggplot2, which allows for more
   advanced and professional-looking plots. In addition to plotting, I learned about basic statistical functions used to summarize
   and describe data. I studied the data structures in R—vectors, matrices and arrays, lists, and data frames. Toward the end, I
   also practiced how to import data into R, which is essential for working with real datasets. After R, I started working with
   SPSS. Although I didn’t learn much in depth, I was able to import files and create basic plots like histograms. SPSS seemed easy
   on the surface but felt slightly confusing compared to R, probably because it's more menu-driven and less code-based.

   There weren’t any major blockers today, although SPSS was a bit confusing at first. However, I’m sure that with more practice,
   I’ll get used to it.


reflection: |
  Today felt like a full and productive day of learning. Starting R was exciting because I got to see how data can be visualized in
  different ways, which made me feel more confident working with data. SPSS, on the other hand, was a bit confusing at first, likely
  because it was new to me and uses a different interface compared to R. I hope to continue learning SPSS tomorrow and become more
  comfortable with it. I’m focused on learning as much as I can during this research experience and truly appreciate the opportunity
  to explore new tools and skills.
