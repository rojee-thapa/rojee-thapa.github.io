what_i_learned: |
   Today I learned the different concepts of statistics, focusing on various probability distributions. I used the Python libraries
   like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
   Descriptive Statistics: Analyzed data using measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
   Uniform Distribution: Studied distributions where all outcomes are equally likely to occur within a specified range.
   Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Examined how probabilities accumulate over a range of values.
   Normal (Gaussian) Distribution: Explored the bell-shaped curve representing data symmetrically distributed around the mean.
   Binomial Distribution: is a discrete probability distribution that models the outcomes of a given number of random trails of some
   experiment or event.
   Geometric and Exponential Distributions: Analyzed the number of trials until the first success and the time it takes for an event
   to occur.
