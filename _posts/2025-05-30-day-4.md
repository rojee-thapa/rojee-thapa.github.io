what_i_learned: |
  We started the day by continuing our Python course from yesterday and worked on solving some coding problems, which helped me practice what we’ve been learning. After lunch, we learned about Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We got a quick introduction to AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative AI, Neural Networks, Prompt Engineering, how LLMs work, and things like Tokenization and Embeddings. We even had a quiz on these topics, which made it more fun and helped me remember what we learned. 
  
  Later, we did an activity where we had to guess if some pictures were made by AI or not. Most were easy, but a few were really surprising!

blockers: |
  There weren’t really any big blockers today. The only small challenge was trying to figure out a couple of AI-generated pictures—they looked so real that it was hard to tell!

reflection: |
  Overall, today was a good day. I learned a lot of new and interesting things, especially about how AI and LLMs work. The quiz and picture activity made the session fun and different from usual. Since this was our last day of virtual classes, I’m really excited to meet everyone in person on Monday and start working on our projects. Looking forward to what’s coming next!
