what_i_learned: |
   Today Our graduate mentor introduced us to a new technique called ASAIM (Accelerated Self-Adaptive Iterative Method), which helps solve the overfitting problem we had with our custom ELM (Extreme Learning Machine). I worked with the Alzheimer’s disease dataset, using a balanced version without cross-validation. I applied the ASAIM model and compared its performance with other models like custom ELM, traditional ELM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). I created bar plots to visualize the accuracy and RMSE percentage difference across all models. I also completed the abstract section of my research paper, adding the new results from ASAIM.

   I didn’t face any major issues today, but I did have a small challenge with the ASAIM code. Since this method was new to me, I had trouble understanding parts like PQi and gradientOfL. The issue turned out to be a minor coding mistake in how I placed those functions. Once I fixed that, the model ran smoothly. It helped me understand the algorithm better.



reflection: |
   Overall, today went very smoothly. I made good progress on my research paper, especially with the abstract. I also received helpful feedback from both my graduate mentor and high school teacher. Their suggestions helped me see how others might read and understand my work. I made changes based on their advice to make my writing clearer and easier to follow. Learning about ASAIM was exciting, and it was fun to try something new. I feel more confident in my understanding of both the models and the research process.
