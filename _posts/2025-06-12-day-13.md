what_i_learned: |
   Today at SAIRI Cohort Connect, we started the day with some fun team games—Taboo and Jenga. Taboo was especially enjoyable
   because it brought out everyone’s competitive side, and although Jenga didn’t last long, it was still a great way to begin the
   morning. Later, we learned how to use Overleaf. It was my first time using it, but I found it easy to navigate and helpful for
   writing. I also continued working with SPSS and was glad to solve the file issue I had yesterday. Compared to R, SPSS felt more
   user-friendly since I didn’t have to code, and it was great for analyzing and visualizing data. Today, I learned more about what
   SPSS can do and spent time analyzing the demo.sav dataset.

reflection: |
   I really enjoyed the balance of fun and learning.  Learning new tools like Overleaf and SPSS gave me confidence in my ability to
   learn new things. It felt good toovercome a challenge I had with SPSS, and that success motivated me to keep exploring. I liked
   how smooth the learning processfelt today, and I’m excited to keep that energy going tomorrow. Overall, it was a meaningful and
   productive day.
