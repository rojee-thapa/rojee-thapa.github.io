what_i_learned: |
   I started the day by working on our final presentation. Since we already had a PowerPoint from our mid-week presentation, it made things easier. I had a rough outline ready, so I just filled in the rest. After that, I focused on writing the final research paper. I completed the methodology section, which was the last part I needed to write. Later, our graduate mentor asked us to include the balanced results with cross validation in our paper. I already had the code, so I made the changes required, ran it, and added the results to our Overleaf document.

   Luckily, today was smooth and I didn’t face any major blockers. 

reflection: |
   This is the last week of the program, and I feel both happy and a bit nervous. I’m proud of how far we’ve come and the work we’ve done. Writing the slides for the final presentation was easier this time compared to the first one, where I felt stuck at the beginning. Today felt very productive, and it was nice to see how much I’ve learned over the course of the program. I’m excited but also a little anxious for the final presentation ahead.
