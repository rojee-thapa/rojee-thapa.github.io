what_i_learned: |
   today was another full day of coding and testing. I focused on evaluating the Parkinson’s disease dataset using balanced data without cross-validation. I had already done the other two setups—imbalanced data without cross-validation and balanced data with cross-validation—so this was the final piece. Luckily, this part went smoothly, and I was able to run the models and collect the results without any errors. After that, I updated my Overleaf report with both today’s and yesterday’s results to keep everything organized.

   While going through the results, I noticed that something wasn’t quite right with the percentage difference values between training and testing metrics. At first, I wasn’t sure if it was a bug or just a logic issue. With the help of my graduate mentor, I figured out it was a logical error in how I calculated the difference. It wasn’t a big mistake, but it was enough to affect result. After fixing the function and updating the code, the results finally made more sense.
   


reflection: |
   Looking back, I thought I was done yesterday, but today showed me that there’s always room for improvement. Even small details like one line of code can have a big impact on the final outcome. I learned that it’s important not just to run the models, but also to take time to review and understand the results properly. The next step is to finish writing the conclusion and observations based on the results. Overall, it was a productive day filled with learning and understanding.
