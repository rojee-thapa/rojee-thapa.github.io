what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on my part of the presentation and also teamed up one of my group member to make the demo video. After creating the video, we showed it to our graduate mentor. She gave us helpful feedback, and we made the changes she suggested. Then we finished the final version of the demo video. Later, we presented our presentation to our faculty mentor. He gave us ideas on how to improve our slides and how to present better. We listened to his advice, updated our slides, and practiced our presentation to be ready for tomorrow.

  
blockers: |
  I didn’t face any big blockers today, but getting feedback and making changes took more time than we expected.
  
reflection: |
  Today was very productive. I learned how important it is to take feedback seriously and use it to improve my work. Working with my team helped us stay focused and organized. Practicing the presentation also made me feel more confident. I’m glad we finished everything and are ready for tomorrow. Since today was our last day in the lab, it made me realize how far I’ve come and how much I’ve learned since the first day.
