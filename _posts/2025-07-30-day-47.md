what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned a lot about Open Source Computer Vision and YOLO (You Only Look Once). We had a guest speaker who introduced us to the concept of Open Source Computer Vision and explained how it’s used to help machines understand images and videos. We also learned how to use Teachable Machine, a tool that allows us to train a model to recognize objects in images. I captured three images and trained the model to identify them, and it was amazing to see how quickly it recognized those objects. After that, we moved on to YOLO, a computer vision model built by Ultralytics. We used Google Colab to import YOLO and tested it on a picture and a short video to analyze how well it detects different objects. Additionally, we continued our Python lessons from yesterday, revisiting dictionaries and sets, and we worked with file operations. We practiced file input/output, learning how to read from, write to, and append data to files. Although there was a lot of new information, I feel like I gained a solid foundation in these areas.
  
blockers: |
  There weren’t many blockers today. The instructors made sure to go at a slow pace and checked that everyone was following along. This made it easier to keep up with the new material, and I didn’t feel overwhelmed. Everything was explained clearly, and we were given time to practice and ask questions, which helped a lot.
  
reflection: |
  The day was a mix of excitement and a little challenge. The image recognition tasks were fun, but the technical parts of YOLO and Python coding took some time to figure out. We worked through some problems, which helped me become more familiar with solving Python exercises. The escape room was a fun break and also gave me a chance to connect with the team. Overall, I’m excited to learn even more tomorrow.
