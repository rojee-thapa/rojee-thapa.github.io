what_i_learned: |
   Today, I worked with raw Parkinson's data and completed several tasks related to data cleaning, exploration, and model training. I learned how to clean the data by inspecting the dataset for duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns, then applying methods like mean or mode imputation to fill in the gaps. I also learned how to encode categorical features and handle outliers using box plots. For the exploratory data analysis (EDA), I created visualizations like correlation heatmaps and bar charts to understand the relationships between features and the distribution of the target variable.  And selected the important features. Additionally, I practiced balancing an imbalanced dataset using SMOTE and observed the impact on the correlation matrix. In terms of model training, I trained several machine learning models like ELM, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, and evaluated their performance using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, and MAE. Finally, I compared how the models performed on both balanced and unbalanced datasets.

   I wasn't expecting to have many problems with training and testing since I had been working on it all week, but I did run into a small issue due to my mistake. I one-hot encoded the status to 0 and 1 and then standardized it, even though it wasn't necessary. This caused the values to change to something like 0.2345 and -1.564, which caused issues during training. However, I eventually figured out the problem when I ran the code from the beginning and traced where things went wrong.
   


reflection: |
   This whole week was really productive, and I learned a lot of new things. It was especially helpful to understand what the project is expecting from us and to work with real data. I realized that even though I thought I knew machine learning, thereâ€™s always something new to learn and improve on. Working with real-world data also showed me how messy and complex it can be, and how important it is to clean and preprocess the data properly. I also learned how different models behave and how to evaluate them in a more detailed way. Overall, it was a great experience that helped me improve my skills and gain more confidence.
