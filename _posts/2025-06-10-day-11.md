what_i_learned: |
   Today, I continued learning MATLAB by practicing switch statements, importing Excel and CSV files, and plotting data. I followed along with a tutorial video and paused it often to try things out myself. This approach helped me understand the material better. Today I started with switch statement which is useful for checking different conditions and makes the code easier to read compared to using many “if-else” statements. I also learned how to import data from Excel and CSV files using functions like readmatrix, readtable. After that, I practiced plotting, which was fun. I made a few simple plots, added labels, and changed colors. It made me realize how helpful MATLAB is for visualizing data.
 

  
blockers: |
 There weren’t any major blockers today, but MATLAB did freeze a few times. I had to restart my laptop three or four times. It was a bit annoying, but eventually it worked fine again. I’m not sure if the problem was with MATLAB or my laptop, but I’m glad it got resolved.


reflection: |
  Overall, today was a good and balanced day. I learned useful skills in MATLAB that I’m sure will be helpful in our research. Watching the tutorial and practicing step by step made a big difference in how much I understood.

  
Even though I had a small issue with the software, I was able to solve it and keep learning. A nice part of today was a small birthday celebration for a member of our research team. It felt good to be included, and it added a positive moment to the day. The birthday celebration reminded me how nice it is to be part of a team that also values little moments together. I’m looking forward to learning more tomorrow and seeing how we’ll apply MATLAB in our actual research work.
