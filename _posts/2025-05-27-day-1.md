what_i_learned: |
   Today marked the first day of the 2025 CEAMLS Summer Research Internship. We began by introducing ourselves and getting to know the other students in the program. It was a great opportunity to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds and interests.
   I also met my team members, and we started building connections that will be important as we work together throughout the internship. We participated in a fun speed networking bingo activity that encouraged us to interact with many fellow interns. Additionally, we completed a placement test.
   A key part of today’s session was an introduction to Git and GitHub. We learned how to use version control to manage our code and collaborate effectively.It was a valuable and informative start to the internship, setting a strong foundation for the technical skills we'll be using in future.
