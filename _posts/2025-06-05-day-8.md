what_i_learned: |
   Today, I continued learning Python, especially focusing on frequency tables and           plotting using pandas.
   Frequency Tables I learned how to analyze relationships between different columns using    one-way, two-way, and higher-dimensional tables. I practiced making cross tables that     show how values in one column relate to values in another.
   Plotting with pandas I created different kinds of visualizations like histograms, box      plots, density plots, bar plots, and scatterplots. These plots help to understand and     explore data better, which will be really useful for our research.

  

  
  
blockers: |
  There weren’t any major blockers today. The video was easy to follow and understand. I    was able to go through it smoothly and complete the exercises without any confusion.


reflection: |
   We started the day with a campus tour. Even though I’ve been at Morgan for almost two     years, I visited parts of the campus I hadn’t seen before. It made me realize how I       mostly stay around the buildings where I have classes. It was sunny and the walk was a    bit tiring, but it was still nice to see more of the campus.

   After the tour, Dr. Mack walked us through how our presentations will look. We even       watched a video from last year’s group, which gave me a good idea of what to expect.      In the afternoon, I got back to the research lab and focused on my Python practice.       Overall, I feel confident about today’s work and ready for tomorrow’s presentation
