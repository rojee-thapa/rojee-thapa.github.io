what_i_learned: |
   Today, I worked with real-world data and applied various machine learning models such as SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. I used the breast cancer
   dataset from sklearn. I learned how to handle missing values, split the data into features and target variables, and compute various metrics such as accuracy,
   MAE, MSE, RMSE, and percentage difference. Additionally, I explored the time taken to train and test each model, which highlighted the computational efficiency
   of different algorithms. Plotting confusion matrices and correlation matrices helped me visualize the models' performance and understand the results better. Even
   though I used the same data for all models, the outcomes varied, which shows how different algorithms can have different results. This exercise gave me a deeper
   understanding of model comparison and the importance of evaluating multiple metrics.
 

  
blockers: |
   There weren’t any major issues with the coding, but I did make a few typos that caused some errors. Another challenge was understanding the different models and 
   figuring out how to use them effectively, but there were no major blockers.
   


reflection: |
   Working with these different models was a great learning experience. It gave me a chance to understand how each algorithm works and how small changes in data or
   the way the model is built can lead to different results. I realized that while accuracy is important, it’s not the only thing to look at. Other metrics like MSE 
   and RMSE helped me understand the model's performance and where it was making errors. I also saw how helpful tools like confusion and correlation matrices are in 
   making sense of the results. Overall, I feel more confident in comparing and evaluating different models, and I’m excited to use this knowledge in future 
   projects. Reading research papers also gave me a better idea of how these models are used in real-life problems.
