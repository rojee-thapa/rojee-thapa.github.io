what_i_learned: |
   I used MATLAB for the first time today, and it went really well and was exciting. It was simpler to understand the basic concepts when I downloaded the software and followed along with an instructional video. I learned  fundamental ideas like creating vectors and matrices, performing arithmetic operations, and indexing arrays. Along with commands like clc, clear, and shut all, I studied built-in functions like max(), abs(), round(), sqrt(), and linspace(). Additionally, I started working with for loops, logical statements (if, elseif, else), and custom and anonymous functions. I also did basic graphing, using polyfit() and polyval() to fit curves, and applying logic to practical situations like weather tracking.

 Today, there were no major obstacles.   It was simple to follow along because the topics were introductory and well-guided. I learnt the basic of Matlab instead of diving further into it.


reflection: |
  I want to be able to keep studying and improving without any problems. Being able to learn something new was wonderful. It helped me realize how much I still have to learn, and I'm thrilled that this internship would allow me to pick up new skills. I hope that everything goes well this week. And I hope to be able to learn and use MATLAB without any difficulties in the future.
