what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent most of my time working on my final research paper and presentation. I continued right where I left off yesterday. First, I finished explaining the results in my paper and completed the literature review section. After that, I moved on to the presentation. It was almost done, so I just made some final changes to my parts. I also made all the edits and changes suggested by our faculty mentor and graduate mentor. I learned how to clearly present my findings and connect them to the work done in previous studies. Working closely with my mentor helped me understand how to improve both the content and structure of my paper.

blockers: |
  I didn’t face any blockers today. Everything went smoothly, and I was able to focus on my tasks. I had my faculty mentor's help, which made it easier to  complete the work without any major issues.

reflection: |
  Today felt great because I got a lot done, and both the paper and the presentation looks good. I feel proud of the work, but I’m also a bit nervous about the final presentation. I hope everything goes well and there are no last-minute problems. I’m glad I had help from my mentor. Finishing both tasks gave me a sense of accomplishment and relief. I’m learning that being well-prepared and open to feedback makes a big difference.
