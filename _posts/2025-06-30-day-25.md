what_i_learned: |
   Today, I continued working with the Parkinson’s disease dataset and made predictions using different metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, accuracy, and the percentage difference in RMSE through cross-validation. I used KNN,  SVM, Random forest, decision tree and ELM. I also focused on balancing the dataset and repeated the same process as before. I created important visualizations such as correlation plots, histograms, and box plots using the selected features. Additionally, I spent time studying Parkinson’s disease to better understand its background and medical importance, which will help me write the  introduction for the project.

  
blockers: |
   There weren’t any major blockers today, but I did face some coding errors when trying out different machine learning models. These were mostly small issues related to syntax or model compatibility, which I was able to debug and resolve. Overall, the process went smoothly.
   


reflection: |
   Today was a good day for learning. I found out more about Parkinson’s disease and how helpful it will be if machine learning can help detect it early. By working directly with the data, making graphs, and testing models, I got a better idea of the real challenges in analyzing health data. It was interesting to see how balancing the data didn’t change the results much. I’m looking forward to moving ahead and clearly defining the main problem and questions my project will focus on.
