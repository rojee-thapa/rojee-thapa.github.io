what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first in-person orientation. The session briefly introduced what the CEAMLS program is about. I learned about the roles of our mentors, our responsibilities as undergraduate researchers, and the expectations for our weekly and final projects. We were also shown what our schedules will look like in the upcoming weeks. During our first research lab meeting, we were introduced to the team and began working on our research projects by installing Anaconda and starting with Python for data analysis. We were provided with a video tutorial that was easy to follow. I reviewed familiar Python concepts such as strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries. Additionally, I was introduced to NumPy arrays, which are used for efficient numerical computations. This was a new and important concept for me in the context of data science.

  Understanding NumPy arrays was a bit challenging at first, since it was a new concept. However, after some practice and watching the video, it started to make more sense.

reflection: |
  Overall, today was a great start to the research experience. The orientation helped me understand the program's goals and introduced me to the team I’ll be working with. I enjoyed participating in the Marshmallow Challenge—it was fun, encouraged teamwork, and helped break the ice with my group. Meeting my research lab team and starting technical work made the experience feel real and exciting. Despite the initial difficulty with NumPy arrays, I’m proud of the progress I made. I’m looking forward to building on what I learned and becoming more confident with tools like NumPy in the days ahead.
