what_i_learned: |
   From today’s research paper review, I learned that machine learning was used to predict diseases like heart disease 
   by applying different types of models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Random Forests. Simple models like 
   Logistic Regression are easy to understand, but Random Forests usually give better results. I also found out that 
   methods like cross-validation and learning curves are important for checking how well these models perform and for 
   avoiding mistakes. Preparing the data properly and selecting the right features can make a big difference in the 
   accuracy of the models. Lastly, I realized that making these models easy to understand is the main focus. Logistic
   Regression is a simple method used topredict the chance of something happening, usually when there are only two 
   possible outcomes—like yes or no. For example, in the research paper, it is used to predict whether a patient has 
   heart disease based on their health data. Cross-validation helps improve accuracy by splitting the data into multiple 
   folds and repeatedly training and testing the model on different folds to get more reliable performanc
  
blockers: |
   Today, I didn’t face any blockers while learning. The only concern I had was about what we will be presenting in 
   Friday’s presentation, but now I think I have an idea of what to do.
   


reflection: |
   Today, I read a research paper carefully and learned how different machine learning methods were used to compare 
   predictions and find the best one. Our group was confused about our own research and what we were supposed to do. Dr. 
   Mack helped by bringing our concerns to the faculty mentor so they could explain the project more clearly. Our 
   mentors promised to be more open and explain the process better so we don’t feel confused. After that, things became 
   clearer, and I could see how what we have been doing connects to our research. It also helped me understand how our 
   work can be useful for future studies.
