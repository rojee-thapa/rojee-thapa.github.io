what_i_learned: |
   Today, I learned some important tips on writing and presenting research. Dr. Anita shared how to create effective PowerPoint slides and present them with confidence. She also explained how to write key sections of a research paper, such as the summary, findings, and how to discuss shortcomings. In addition to the workshop, I continued working on my Overleaf document, completing the explanation of the results table and making necessary changes to my explanations. This helped me understand how to write the results in more detail.


  
blockers: |
   There were no blockers or issues today. Everything went smoothly during both the workshop and while updating my Overleaf.
   


reflection: |
   Today was a productive day because I made significant progress on updating my Overleaf document, especially for the Python results section. I spent time writing the explanations for the tables and added some bar charts to visually represent my data. It felt good to finish this part of the task without running into any major difficulties. The workshop also helped me improve my understanding of how to present my research more effectively.
