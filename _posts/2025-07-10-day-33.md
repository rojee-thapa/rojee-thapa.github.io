what_i_learned: |
   Today, we had a research-based writing fundamentals workshop led by Dr. Anita, which was incredibly helpful. She walked us through the structure of a technical research paper, explaining how to approach each section—from the title and introduction to methodology, results, conclusion, and references. Dr. Anita also emphasized that writing technical papers doesn't have to be overwhelming. By breaking it into parts and focusing on clarity and purpose, she helped us see that writing is a process that can be approached with confidence rather than fear. I now have a much clearer idea of how to begin drafting my own paper and how to structure each section effectively.Alongside the workshop, I continued working on my MATLAB project. Today’s focus was on handling data imbalance, for which I used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Since MATLAB does not include a built-in SMOTE function, I had to download one from the MATLAB File Exchange and add it into my MATLAB. I was able to balance my dataset successfully and run classification models—KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest and my customized ELM—without using cross-validation.

   There were no major blockers today and everything ran smoothly.
   


reflection: |
   Overall today was a productive and informative day. I learned how to implement data balancing in MATLAB and gained a clearer understanding of how to write a research paper. Realizing the importance of clear, structured writing has made me feel more confident about starting the writing phase of my project. I now see how essential it is to communicate research findings effectively—not just to show results, but to present them in a way that helps others understand the purpose and contributions of our work. I hope to carry this knowledge forward into future academic writing and make the most of what I learned today.
