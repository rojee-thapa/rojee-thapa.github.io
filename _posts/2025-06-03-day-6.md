what_i_learned: |
  On my second day with the research team, I continued from where I left off yesterday and started the Python data analysis video and practice. I worked on several core Python concepts, including if-elif-else statements, for and while loops (along with break and continue), as well as list and dictionary comprehensions. I also practiced defining functions using *args and **kwargs, and explored the use of lambda functions.
On the data analysis side, I focused on working with pandas, particularly exploring Series and DataFrame objects. I began working with external datasets by loading .csv files, examining their contents, and creating histograms. The entire day was dedicated to learning Python for data analysis.

  
  
blockers: |
  There were no major blockers today. Everything progressed smoothly, and I was able to follow along with the material without any significant issues. It was a productive day focused on learning.


reflection: |
  Today was all about learning Python. Practicing both basic and intermediate concepts really helped boost my confidence. I'm excited to keep learning and looking forward to tackling more complex data tasks in the next few days.We even had a little moment when the fire alarm went offâ€”definitely something unexpected to add to the day!
