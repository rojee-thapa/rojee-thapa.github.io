what_i_learned: |
  Today, we began with an introduction to the faculty and graduate mentors from the different research groups. I met with my project group, where we introduced ourselves and discussed the details of our project, including the programming languages we’ll be using. And what we will be doing for our research.
  We continued our GitHub lesson from yesterday, learning how to make changes to the website. Later, we split into groups for a Python session, where we reviewed dictionaries and sets—a helpful refresher that made these concepts easier to understand.

blockers: |
  There were no significant blockers today. Everything ran smoothly, and the sessions were easy to follow and engaging.

reflection: |
  It was a productive and fun day. Meeting the mentors and getting to know more about our project helped me feel more motivated and focused. The hands-on GitHub work was helped me, and the Python course was a great way to understand and review. Ending the day with a fun game  and updating our blogs made the experience both educational and enjoyable.
