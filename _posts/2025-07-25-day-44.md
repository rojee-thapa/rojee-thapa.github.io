what_i_learned: |
  Today was a pretty exciting day! I attended a presentation by Dr. Chris Crawford from the University of Alabama, where he talked about Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). BCIs allow us to control devices with our minds, and that really blew my mind! Dr. Crawford explained how these systems work by reading signals from the brain. In the workshop, we got to try it out ourselves. One activity involved using an EEG headset to control a drone, where the computer processed the brain signals and turned them into commands. We also tried using muscle signals to control devices, which felt like science fiction! It was fascinating to see how all this works, and it made me appreciate the technology even more. I returned to lab and worked on my final research paper.

  Thankfully, there were no blockers today! Everything went smoothly.


reflection: |
  Overall, I feel grateful for the opportunity to learn about BCIs. It’s amazing how we can control things just with our thoughts, and I never thought I’d have the chance to experience it firsthand. I also feel more confident about my research. I finished coding yesterday and today I added the result table and bar plot to my paper. Explaining the results is easier compared to the beginning, and I think I’m getting better at it. The professor also provided some useful feedback on our research paper, which will be a great help.
