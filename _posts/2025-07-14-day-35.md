what_i_learned: |
   Today was a productive day as I continued working on my research paper using Overleaf. I started by correcting my MATLAB code for balancing the data using cross-
   validation. After updating the results, my graduate mentor helped me outlined the structure of my paper, which gave me a clear idea of how to begin writing. I 
   wrote the introduction, explained the disease, and described the features used in the dataset. I also covered the data cleaning process and the correlation 
   heatmap, including what insights could be gained from it. Finally, I worked on explaining the histogram for both the balanced and imbalanced data


  
blockers: |
   There weren’t any major blockers today, just that getting started felt a bit hard. One of the most challenging parts was trying to explain the plots and the code 
   in a way that a reader could easily understand. It made me think more deeply about what I’ve learned and how well I understand the material. Writing about the 
   technical steps, like the preprocessing and visualizations, took more time than expected, especially trying to keep the explanations simple and clear.
   


reflection: |
   Writing today helped me realize how much I actually understand the work I’ve done so far. It also showed me which parts I still need to think more about. Even 
   though it felt a bit slow and difficult at times, I believe with practice I’ll get more comfortable explaining complex ideas in writing. The process was a good 
   reminder that learning doesn’t stop at coding — being able to communicate it clearly is just as important.
