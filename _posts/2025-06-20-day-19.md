what_i_learned: |
   Today I continued learning more about CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and how they are used in machine learning.
   I followed a YouTube video that walked through a simple coding example, which helped me understand the basic
   structure of CNNs. It showed how layers are added and how the model learns from images. After that, I read 4-5
   research papers related to machine learning. These papers explained how machine learning can solve different real
   world problems. Most of the papers used at least 3-4 different machine learning models to compare their results.
   Reading both the papers and watching the video helped me see the practical side of what I’m learning.

   Today I had some trouble when I first started working with CNN on Anaconda. I didn’t have TensorFlow installed, and
   after installing it, my NumPy and Pandas libraries stopped working. Since fixing it was taking too long, I decided to
   continue practicing on Google Colab instead. CNN feels quite different from the previous models I’ve used like KNN,
   SVM, decision tree, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.


reflection: |
   Since today was Friday, we had to present our weekly progress to our faculty mentor, which gave me a chance to
   organize my thoughts. After the individual update, we also did our group presentation and shared what we had learned
   throughout the week. I realized that this week was packed with new information, and at times, it felt like a lot to
   take in. However, as I continue working with machine learning, I believe it will become easier to understand with
   more practice. I’m starting to see how powerful machine learning can be, and I’m excited to keep learning. Even
   though it’s challenging, I’m motivated to improve. I think I’ll become more confident using these tools as I apply
   them in our research.
