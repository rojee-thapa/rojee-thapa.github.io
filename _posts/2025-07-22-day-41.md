what_i_learned: |
   Today, I worked with my team to create and practice a 90-second elevator pitch for our research project. We started by writing the script together, making sure it was clear and to the point. Then we divided the script so each person had a part to present. After our first practice run, we realized the script was too long, so we made changes to fit the time limit. We practiced a few more times and recorded a version to share with our mentors. They gave us helpful feedback, so we plan to record the final version soon. Our high school mentor, Ron, also gave us suggestions to improve the script and helped with the video. After that, I continued working on my Overleaf project. I made the necessary improvements suggested by professor. I also had a discussion with my graduate mentor about our research paper, which helped me get a clear idea of how to get started.


  
blockers: |
   There were no big blockers today. The only small challenge we had was needing a few retakes during the video recording. But it wasnâ€™t a big problem, and we had fun doing it together. Everything else went smoothly.



reflection: |
   Working on the pitch was a fun and helpful experience. At first, our script was too long, but after practicing and editing the script, we were able to make it better. Everyone in the group had a part to say, and we helped each other improve. After a few retakes, we recorded a good version of the pitch. When we shared it with our mentors, they gave us helpful feedback. Our mentor Ron also gave us tips to improve the script. It felt great and we had fun working on the video as a team.
