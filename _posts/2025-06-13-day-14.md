what_i_learned: |
   Today, I started by learning Tableau. It was a smooth process, and I found the tool easy to use for creating visualizations. After that,
   I moved on to Overleaf, where I learned how to write numerical expressions, although I didn’t get through all the features yet. Later, I
   worked with SPSS using a provided dataset. I was tasked with identifying missing values, either replacing or removing them, finding the
   midpoint of age, and using it to calculate height and weight. Then, I used those values to compute BMI. I also standardized the data, 
   calculated correlations, and created at least three different types of plots. Although I couldn’t complete the final question, this
   exercise helped me understand how to apply SPSS to real-world data.

   There was no blocker today.


reflection: |
   Using SPSS for practical tasks made the learning experience more meaningful, and I believe this will help me remember the steps more
   effectively. Presenting my weekly progress to our research team and during the weekly report session gave me a chance to reflect on what
   I’ve accomplished. Overall, today was productive, and I feel like I’m starting to get more comfortable with both learning and applying
   new tools. I’m looking forward to the weekend and excited about what’s coming next.
