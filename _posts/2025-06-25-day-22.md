what_i_learned: |
   Today, I read a research paper and tried to implement the same approach using the dataset mentioned in the paper. I built a heart disease prediction model using 
   machine learning techniques on a real-world dataset. I learned how to preprocess the data by applying one-hot encoding to categorical features and standardizing 
   numerical features for consistent scaling. I split the dataset into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio, where only the test set was used to evaluate the 
   final model accuracy. I implemented and compared several models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. I evaluated each 
   modelâ€™s performance using both accuracy on the test set and 5-fold cross-validation to understand how well the models could generalize to new data. I also 
   learned that SMOTE is used to balance class distributions but should only be applied to the training data to avoid data leakage. This project helped me 
   understand the machine learning workflow and best practices for evaluating models.

   While implementing the code, I faced a problem when using SMOTE to balance the data. At first, I applied SMOTE before splitting the data and used it on the whole 
   dataset. This caused my results to be unreliable and less accurate. After discussing the issue with my graduate mentor, she explained that SMOTE should only be 
   used on the training data, not the entire dataset. Once I corrected this, the model started working properly.

   This project helped me understand how different machine learning methods can be used with real-world data. I learned the importance of proper data preprocessing, 
   such as handling categorical and numerical features. Working with cross-validation and class balancing gave me a better understanding of how to improve model 
   performance. I also realized how important it is to avoid common mistakes like data leakage. Overall, this experience gave me more confidence in applying machine 
   learning to real problems.
