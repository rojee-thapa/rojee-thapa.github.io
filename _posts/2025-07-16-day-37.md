what_i_learned: |
   Today, I learned a lot about how to clearly present and explain the results in my Overleaf document. I organized my result tables into two sections: one for analysis without cross validation and one with cross validation. For both sections, I included results from balanced and imbalanced datasets. Explaining the results in detail helped me understand the performance of each model. I also spent time reading about each evaluation metric, which gave me a deeper understanding of how to measure and compare the models effectively. Additionally, my graduate mentor gave me some helpful feedback on how I can improve my explanations and pointed out what was missing.



  
blockers: |
   One challenge I faced today was managing many different result tables in Overleaf. It got a bit confusing, and I accidentally filled in the wrong table with some results. When I reviewed the tables, some of them didn’t look right, which made me go back and check everything. I realized the mistake and corrected it.
   


reflection: |
   Even though there were some mistakes and challenges, today was a very productive day. Explaining the results clearly not only improved my document but also helped me understand the concepts much better. Going through the metrics and thinking about how to explain them gave me more confidence. I feel like I made good progress, and I’m happy with how things are going. Hopefully, I can continue this work tomorrow and finish updating the Overleaf.
