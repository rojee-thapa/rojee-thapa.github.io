what_i_learned: |
   Today I was assigned a new Research Paper. Based on the research paper, I learned that machine learning(ML) involves a wide range of algorithms used to analyze data and make intelligent decisions. I understood the key difference between supervise, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and how each serves unique purposes in solving real-world-problems. I explored various algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, k-means clustering and neural networks. I learned how feature selection and dimensionality reduction improve model performance. The paper emphasized the importance of algorithm selection based on data type and problem. I also got to learn about Association Rule Learning, Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning and the various application of machine learning. The paper also mentioned current challenges in ML and the many opportunities for future research and development. 

  
blockers: |
   I didn't have any specific blockers today, except when reading the paper and trying to remember or fully understand all the information. Some parts were dense and complex, which made it a bit challenging to absorb everything at once.
   


reflection: |
   For the past few weeks, I have been learning about machine learning and implementing its different methods. Today, reading a full research paper focused on machine learning and its role in the modern digital world made me realize how important and useful it is in our daily lives. I already had basic knowledge about machine learning—its types and some methods—but I gained so much new and detailed information from this paper. It was a lot to take in, but extremely useful. I learned how various algorithms work, how data quality affects performance, and how different ML techniques are applied in fields like healthcare, cybersecurity, and smart cities. This deeper understanding has increased my interest in the field and inspired me to explore more advanced concepts in the future. I hope to study the paper more thoroughly tomorrow and gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.
