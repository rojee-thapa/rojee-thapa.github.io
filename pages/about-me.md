  bio: |
    I’m currently a senior studying Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2026.

    My major focuses on understanding how computers work, from software development and algorithms to data structures and artificial intelligence.

    When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy reading books and watching movies to relax.
